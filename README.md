Download or clone the repo, then install dependencies. This was made using create react app.

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

## Notes on the test:

Initially I made the chart using **Recharts** however it soon became clear that I couldn't manipulate the x axis to the 24hr time frame in 3 hourly steps, without amending the actual data object. After some researching, I found **Chart.js** provided me with more options, please refer to the file called **graph2.js** to see my chart code.

You can click on the **HOME, ABOUT, CONTACT** links to see some more information on me and the test.

> ## Suggested Libraries

You gave a great list of suggested tools, some of which I have used in the past, however I found I didn't have to use most of your tools for this test, for example **Ramda, styled-components, Typescript, Reselect, redux-obsversable.** This could be due to my lack of experience, I am open to learn about these tools more and their usefulness.

## Final note

Thank you for your interview and great test challenge, I have learned a lot from using Chart.js and Recharts! I have also refreshed my knowledge on Redux for react. I am hungry to learn more and hungry to work for Roche Diabetes, to work for a great cause and challenging projects.
